Importing the Contract
const SimpleBank = artifacts.require("SimpleBank");
This line imports the compiled SimpleBank contract so we can interact with it in the tests.

Defining the Test Suite
contract("SimpleBank", accounts => {
This function defines the test suite for the SimpleBank contract. The accounts parameter is an array of addresses provided by the Ethereum client (like Ganache).

Before Hook
before(async () => {
  bank = await SimpleBank.deployed();
});
The before hook runs before any test cases in the suite. It deploys the SimpleBank contract and stores the instance in the bank variable.

Test Case: Deposit Funds
it("should deposit funds", async () => {
  const depositAmount = web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether");
  await bank.deposit({ from: accounts[0], value: depositAmount });

  const balance = await bank.getBalance({ from: accounts[0] });
  assert.equal(balance.toString(), depositAmount, "Deposit amount is incorrect");
});
This test case deposits 1 ether into the bank contract from accounts[0] and checks if the balance is updated correctly.

it("should withdraw funds", async () => {
  const withdrawAmount = web3.utils.toWei("0.5", "ether");
  await bank.withdraw(withdrawAmount, { from: accounts[0] });

  const balance = await bank.getBalance({ from: accounts[0] });
  assert.equal(balance.toString(), web3.utils.toWei("0.5", "ether"), "Withdraw amount is incorrect");
});
This test case withdraws 0.5 ether from the bank contract and verifies the balance of accounts[0] is updated correctly.

Test Case: Prevent Withdrawal More Than Balance
it("should not allow withdrawal more than balance", async () => {
  const withdrawAmount = web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether");
  try {
    await bank.withdraw(withdrawAmount, { from: accounts[0] });
    assert.fail("Withdrawal should have failed due to insufficient balance");
  } catch (error) {
    assert.include(error.message, "Insufficient balance", "Incorrect error message");
  }
});
To run the tests, use the following command:

truffle test
